Features Adhering to the Principles of Universal Design

1. Equitable Use  
Our program provides equal access to features and information regardless of the user's ability. For example, it avoids
requiring complex technical skills to operate and a high cognitive load, making it accessible to all users. Future 
improvements could include incorporating high-contrast color modes or avoiding color reliance to ensure accessibility 
for users with color vision deficiencies. We can further implement a setting where users can choose the language to
display information and also include more regions where League of Legends is played.
2. Flexibility in Use  
Our program can fetch data for different summoners in various regions and accommodates different user needs. 
In the future, we could include customizable views or options to prioritize specific statistics based on user 
preferences.
3. Simple and Intuitive Use  
Our program employs clean and simple user interface that is universal across all sections and the same design patterns.
It uses buttons and labeled sections to make interactions intuitive. In the future, we can add information for what 
each button does or section explains and a user guide for users without prior experience with similar tools.
4. Perceptible Information  
Our program presents information visually through a graphical user interface. Labels, numbers, names, IDs are clearly
labeled and displayed in their fields. In the future, we can incorporate icons and visuals alongside text labels to help
users who have difficulty reading or understanding written language, also as part of language barrier. We may also make 
important information be visually distinct to ensure it is noticeable and avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary
information.
5. Tolerance for Error  
Our program handles invalid inputs, including incorrect summoner IDs or region names and displays error messages without
crashing. In the future, we could incorporate a system that suggests possible corrections or valid inputs so users know 
what went wrong and correct without struggling.
6. Low Physical Effort  
Our program provides simple and easy to read/click buttons that minimizes physical effort to fetch data. Our program 
doesn't require complex keyboard shortcuts or manual input processes. In the future, we can incorporate features like 
automatic data updates to reduce even more physical effort. 
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use  
Although this principle applies more to physical spaces, our program ensures interface elements like buttons and labels 
are appropriately spaced and easy to interact with. Our frames and panels are of adequate sizes. In the future, we could
implement adjustable font sizes and layouts for users who require large text or additional spacing.

Target Market

If marketed, we would aim for casual and competitive gamers who play League of Legends, particularly in regions we
have this system available - not all regions where League of Legends is available was included. These users often want 
quick and easy access to data about their performance or other players. The tool could also appeal to esports analysts, 
content creators, or the game company itself looking to explore gaming data as part of solutions architecture analysis. 
Our program aims to bridge the gap between data enthusiasts and gamers with the game itself by providing visually 
engaging and straightforward access to in-game statistics.

Demographic Inclusivity 

The program may be less likely to be used by people unfamiliar with gaming or without access to technology. The program 
is particularly designed for the targeted demographic; who are familiar or plays League of Legends and favors data 
analysis, therefore most audience outside this demographic is opted out. Any non League of Legends players or older 
adults or those without regular access to the internet may find the program irrelevant. Additionally, users with 
disabilities, such as those with visual ro motor impairments, may face challenges without specific accessibility 
features. To mitigate this, we could incorporate assistive technologies such as screen reader support or voice controls.
This aims to foster inclusivity and reducing barriers to entry. Ethical considerations, such as avoiding excessive 
reliance on color or small text, will also ensure greater demographic reach.
