Features Adhering to the Principles of Universal Design

1. Equitable Use  
Our program provides equal access to features and information regardless of the user's ability. For example, it avoids
requiring complex technical skills to operate and a high cognitive load, making it accessible to all users. Future 
improvements could include incorporating high-contrast color modes or avoiding color reliance to ensure accessibility 
for users with color vision deficiencies.
2. Flexibility in Use  
Our program can fetch data for different summoners in various regions and accommodates different user needs. 
In the future, we could include customizable views or options to prioritize specific statistics based on user 
preferences.
3. Simple and Intuitive Use  
Our program employs clean and simple user interface that is universal across all sections and the same design patterns.
It uses buttons and labeled sections to make interactions intuitive. In the future, we can add information for what 
each button does or section explains and a user guide for users without prior experience with similar tools.
4. Perceptible Information  
Our program presents information visually through a graphical user interface. Labels, numbers, names, IDs are clearly
labeled and displayed in their fields. In the future, we can incorporate icons and visuals alongside text labels to help
users who have difficulty reading or understanding written language, also as part of language barrier. We may also make 
important information be visually distinct to ensure it is noticeable and avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary
information.
5. Tolerance for Error  
The program handles invalid inputs, such as incorrect summoner IDs or region names, by displaying error messages without
crashing. In the future, we could enhance this by suggesting possible corrections or valid inputs.
6. Low Physical Effort  
The program minimizes effort by providing simple buttons to fetch data, requiring no complex keyboard shortcuts or
manual input processes. Features like automatic data updates could further reduce physical effort. 
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use  
While this principle applies more to physical spaces, our program ensures interface elements like buttons and labesl are
appropriately spaced and easy to interact with. We could further implement adjustable font sizes and layouts for users 
who require large text or additional spacing.

Target Market

If marketed, we are aiming toward casual and competitive gamers who play League of Legends, particularly in regions we
have this system available - not all regions where League of Legends is available was included. These users often want 
quick and easy access to data about their performance or other players. The tool could also appeal to esports analysts, 
content creators, or the game company itself looking to explore gaming data as part of solutions architecture. By 
providing visually engaging and straightforward access to in-game statistics, the program bridges the gap between data 
enthusiasts and gamers.

Demographic Inclusivity 

The program may be less likely to be used by people unfamiliar with gaming or without access to technology.
For example, older adults or those without regular access to the internet may find the program less relevant.
Additionally, users with disabilities, such as those with visual ro motor impairments, may face challenges
without specific accessibility features. To mitigate this, future iterations could incorporate assistive technologies
such as screen reader support or voice controls, fostering inclusivity and reducing barriers to entry. Ethical
considerations, such as avoiding excessive reliance on color or small text, will also ensure greater demographic reach.
